Code Dojo 12
============
This is my worked example from the 12th (1st anniversary!) meeting of the London Code Dojo in Oct 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You can install the dependencies with:

    npm install

and you can run the tests with:

    npm test

# Different classes of Rule
* Class 1: Cellular automata which rapidly converge to a uniform state. Examples are rules *0*, 32, 160 and 232.
* Class 2: Cellular automata which rapidly converge to a repetitive or stable state. Examples are rules *24*, 108, 218 and 250.
* Class 3: Cellular automata which appear to remain in a random state. Examples are rules 22, 30, 126, *150*, 182.
* Class 4: Cellular automata which form areas of repetitive or stable states, but also form structures that interact with each other in complicated ways. An example is rule *110*. Rule 110 has been shown to be capable of universal computation.


The source of the kata is the Elementary Cellular Automata kata. You can find out more about one-dimentional, or 'elementary' cellular automata at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata)

I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sleepyfox/p/code-dojo-12-october-2012) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
