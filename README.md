Code Dojo 12
============
This is my worked example from the 12th (1st anniversary!) meeting of the London Code Dojo in Oct 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:

    jasmine-node --coffee --verbose test-*

I set up a watchr file (kata.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if you have it installed) with:
    
    watchr kata.watchr

The source of the kata is the Elementary Cellular Automata kata. You can find out more about one-dimentional, or 'elementary' cellular automata at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata)

I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sleepyfox/p/code-dojo-12-october-2012) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
